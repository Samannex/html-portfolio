<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello, my name is Samane Amanpour, and I am a frontend developer with a passion for programming and a major in Geoinformatics. I thrive on creating engaging and user-friendly web experiences that combine my technical skills with my love for design.

As a frontend developer, I specialize in crafting visually appealing and responsive websites that provide seamless interactions for users. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I constantly strive to stay updated with the latest frameworks and technologies.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I have a creative side that I nurture through hobbies such as painting. Exploring different colors and textures allows me to tap into my artistic sensibilities and find inspiration that often translates into my development work. It also serves as a great way to relax and unwind.

Another hobby that I enjoy is taking long walks in nature. Connecting with the outdoors not only rejuvenates me but also sparks my curiosity about the world around us. It aligns well with my Geoinformatics background, as it deepens my understanding of spatial relationships and geographical data.

When I'm seeking mental stimulation and a challenge, I turn to Sudoku puzzles. The logical problem-solving nature of Sudoku exercises my mind and helps me enhance my critical thinking skills. It also reinforces my attention to detail, which is crucial when it comes to coding and debugging complex applications.

Overall, my journey as a frontend developer and geoinformatics enthusiast has allowed me to merge my passion for programming, design, and the exploration of spatial data. I am continuously seeking opportunities to grow both professionally and personally, always ready to take on exciting projects that push the boundaries of what can be achieved through technology.
